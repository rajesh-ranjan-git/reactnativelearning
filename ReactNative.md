## What is React Native?

1. React Native is an open-source framework for building native Android and iOS applications using React.
2. JavaScript to access platform-specific APIs (such as camera and push notifications).
3. React components to define the appearance and behavior of your user interface.
4. React itself is a library designed for building user interfaces.
5. react-dom for web apps and react-native for native mobile apps.

## Why React Native?

1. iOS apps requires Swift or Objective-C.
2. Android apps requires Java or Kotlin.
3. With approximately 31% on iOS and 68% on Android, you would typically need to develop two separate apps using different technologies.
4. With React Native, you can create an app that works seamlessly on both platforms.
5. React Native is in high demand in the job market.
6. Rather than assembling separate teams of iOS and Android developers, businesses can opt for a single team proficient in React native, saving time and money.
7. If the team is well-versed in React, their expertise can extend to web app development as well.

## Expo vs React Native

1. React Native is an open-source framework maintained by Meta (Facebook), designed for building cross-platform apps.
2. Expo is an open-source framework maintained by Expo itself, designed for building cross-platform apps.
3. Unlike plain React Native, which can be challenging and time-consuming to set up, Expo provides a streamlined experience.
4. Expo has a suite of tools and services built around React Native which greatly simplifies the development process.
5. Expo is for React Native just like Next JS is for React JS.
6. With plain React native, you cannot build iOS apps on a windows or linux machine. Native iOS apps can only be built on a macOS machine.
7. With Expo, you can develop your app on windows or linux and run your app on a physical iPhone.

# Expo

-> Expo has evolved significantly over the years and now supports nearly all the features for building mobile apps.
-> In the even that you require access to native Android or iOS code, Expo allows you to eject your app and work with a plain React Native codebase.
-> Expo is the default choice for setting up React Native development environment.
